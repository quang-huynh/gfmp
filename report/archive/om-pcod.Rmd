```
<!-- slot-chunk-end -->

<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### K {#app:desc-stock-k-pc}

*von Bertalanffy growth parameter k. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real numbers*


Lower and upper values of the confidence interval for Hecate Strait and Queen Charlotte Sound combined [@forrest2019, their Appendix C].

```{r desc-stock-k-pc, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}
stock_pc@K <-c(0.17,0.22)
```
<!-- slot-chunk-end -->

<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### t0 {#app:desc-stock-t0-pc}

*von Bertalanffy theoretical age at length zero. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Non-positive real numbers*

Lower and upper values of the confidence interval for Hecate Strait and Queen Charlotte Sound combined [@forrest2019, their Appendix C].

```{r desc-stock-t0-pc, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}

<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### LenCV {#app:desc-stock-lencv-pc}

*Coefficient of variation of length-at-age (assumed constant for all age classes). Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real numbers*

We will grab this from our data analysis:

```{r desc-stock-lencv-pc, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}
sd2cv <- function(.sd) sqrt(exp(.sd^2) - 1)
stock_pc@LenCV <- sd2cv(exp(mvb$pars[["log_sigma"]]))
round(stock_pc@LenCV, 2)
```
<!-- slot-chunk-end -->





<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### L50 {#app:desc-stock-l50-pc}

*Length at 50 percent maturity. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real numbers*

```{r fit-maturity-pc, echo = knitr_echo, out.width="4in", fig.width=6}
m_mat <- gfplot::fit_mat_ogive(dpc$survey_samples, type = "length")
mat_perc <- gfdlm:::extract_maturity_perc(coef(m_mat$model))
se_l50 <- gfdlm:::delta_method(~ -(log((1/0.5) - 1) + x1 + x3) / (x2 + x4),
    mean = coef(m_mat$model), cov = vcov(m_mat$model))
gfplot::plot_mat_ogive(m_mat)
```

From our model, length that 50% maturity for females is calculated as `r round(mat_perc$f.p0.5, 1)` with a standard error of `r round(se_l50, 1)`. Let's pick a range that is roughly the 95% confidence interval around the estimated length that 50% maturity. Length the maturity looks similar for males and females.

```{r desc-stock-l50-pc, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}
stock_pc@L50 <- round(c(-2, 2) * se_l50 + mat_perc$f.p0.5, 1)
stock_pc@L50
```
<!-- slot-chunk-end -->

<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### L50_95 {#app:desc-stock-l50_95-pc}

*Length increment from 50 percent to 95 percent maturity. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real numbers*

Similarly we will calculate the increment in length from 50% to 95% maturity.

```{r desc-stock-l50_95-pc, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}
# TODO: Yikes! Need to check this delta method implementation.
se_l50_95m <- gfdlm:::delta_method(
  ~ -(log((1/0.95) - 1) + x1 + x3) / (x2 + x4) -
    -(log((1/0.5) - 1) + x1 + x3) / (x2 + x4),
    mean = coef(m_mat$model), cov = vcov(m_mat$model))
stock_pc@L50_95 <- round(c(-2, 2) * se_l50_95m + (mat_perc$f.p0.95 - mat_perc$f.p0.5), 1)
stock_pc@L50_95
```
<!-- slot-chunk-end -->

<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### D {#app:desc-stock-d-pc}

*Current level of stock depletion SSB(current)/SSB(unfished). Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Fraction*

TODO: We are probably going to have to bound some reasonable numbers here unless we can fit a basic model such as a surplus production model or a length-based model. For now picking and wide range.

Lower and upper values of the 95% credibility interval of posterior distribution of B2019/B0 [@forrest2019].

```{r desc-stock-d-pc, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}
stock_pc@D <- c(0.45, 0.92)
```
<!-- slot-chunk-end -->

<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### a {#app:desc-stock-a-pc}

*Length-weight parameter alpha. Single value. Positive real number*

We can fit a length-weight growth model with gfplot:

```{r fit-lw-pc, echo = knitr_echo, out.width="4in", fig.width=6}
mlw <- gfplot::fit_length_weight(dpc$survey_samples, sex = "all")

gfplot::plot_length_weight(object_all = mlw, col = c("All" = "black"))
```

We can fill this slot from our fitted model.

```{r desc-stock-a-pc, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}
stock_pc@a <- exp(mlw$pars[["log_a"]])
round(log(stock_pc@a), 2)
```
<!-- slot-chunk-end -->

<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### b {#app:desc-stock-b-pc}

*Length-weight parameter beta. Single value. Positive real number*

We can take this from our fitted model.

```{r desc-stock-b-pc, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}
stock_pc@b <- mlw$pars[["b"]]
round(stock_pc@b, 2)
```
<!-- slot-chunk-end -->

<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### Size_area_1 {#app:desc-stock-size_area_1-pc}

*The default OM has two areas. size_area_1 is the geographical size of the area relative to the TOTAL area.Set to 0.5 to approximate single area model*

```{r desc-stock-size_area_1-pc, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}
stock_pc@Size_area_1 <- c(0.49,0.51)
```
<!-- slot-chunk-end -->

<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### Frac_area_1 {#app:desc-stock-frac_area_1-pc}

*Frac_area_1 is the amount of unfished habitat in that area, expressed as a fraction of the TOTAL habitat.Set to 0.5 to approximate single area model*

For now, we will set this to the same fraction as the size of area 1.

```{r desc-stock-frac_area_1-pc, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}
stock_pc@Frac_area_1 <- c(0.49,0.51)
```
<!-- slot-chunk-end -->

<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### Prob_staying {#app:desc-stock-prob_staying-pc}

*The probability of inviduals in area 1 remaining in area 1 over the course of one year. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive fraction.*

Let's assume Pacific cod is vulnerable in almost all of its range - set a 50% prob of staying in each area.

```{r desc-stock-prob_staying-pc, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}
stock_pc@Prob_staying <- c(0.49,0.51)
```
<!-- slot-chunk-end -->

<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### Fdisc {#app:desc-stock-fdisc-pc}

*Fraction of discarded fish that die. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Non-negative real numbers*

We can assume that nearly 100% of the discarded Pacific Cod die.

```{r desc-stock-fdisc-pc, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}
stock_pc@Fdisc <- 0.99
```
<!-- slot-chunk-end -->

<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### Source {#app:desc-stock-source-pc}

*A reference to a website or article from which parameters were taken to define the stock object. Single value. Character string.*

```{r desc-stock-source-pc, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}
stock_pc@Source <- ""
```
<!-- slot-chunk-end -->


## FLEET SLOT DESCRIPTIONS {#app:desc-fleet-pc}

```{r warnings = FALSE}
fleet_pc <- DLMtool::Generic_Fleet # TODO: temporary
```

<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### Name {#app:desc-fleet-name-pc}

*Name of the Fleet object. Single value. Character string.*

```{r desc-fleet-name-pc, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}
fleet_pc@Name <- "BC Trawl Fleet"
```
<!-- slot-chunk-end -->

<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### nyears {#app:desc-fleet-nyears-pc}

*The number of years for the historical spool-up simulation. Single value. Positive integer*

We will set the historical run-up to be approximately the length of the commercial fishery:

```{r desc-fleet-nyears-pc, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}
fleet_pc@nyears <- 62
```
<!-- slot-chunk-end -->

<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### Spat_targ {#app:desc-fleet-spat_targ-pc}

*Distribution of fishing in relation to spatial biomass: fishing distribution is proportional to B^Spat_targ. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Real numbers*

TODO: Need to dig into the code understand this parameter.

```{r desc-fleet-spat_targ-pc, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}
fleet_pc@Spat_targ
```
<!-- slot-chunk-end -->







<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### L5 {#app:desc-fleet-l5-pc}

*Shortest length corresponding to 5 percent vulnerability. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real numbers*

Based on the slot `isRel` below, this slot needs to be filled in proportion of size-of-maturity. The 95% CI of size at maturity from this analysis is `r stock_pc@L50[[1]]` to `r stock_pc@L50[[2]]`. The shortest length fish in the commercial samples is `r min_caught <- min(dpc$commercial_samples$length, na.rm = TRUE);min_caught`. Presumably much shorter fish could be caught but are not because they are not at locations or depths that would be caught by the gear. That minimum commercial length caught corresponds to between `r round(min_caught/stock_pc@L50[[2]], 1)`- and `r round(min_caught/stock_pc@L50[[1]], 1)`-fold of the length at 50% maturity. Let's take a range a bit wider than that and allow for somewhat smaller fish to possibly be caught. Note that `L5` must be less than `LFS` below.

```{r desc-fleet-l5-pc, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}
fleet_pc@L5 <- c(0.2, 0.4)
```
<!-- slot-chunk-end -->

<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### LFS {#app:desc-fleet-lfs-pc}

*Shortest length that is fully vulnerable to fishing. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real numbers*

Based on the observed commercial length samples this appears to be around or just slightly larger than the length at maturity.

```{r desc-fleet-lfs-pc, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}
fleet_pc@LFS <- c(0.95, 1.1)#c(1.0, 1.2) #
```
<!-- slot-chunk-end -->

<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### Vmaxlen {#app:desc-fleet-vmaxlen-pc}

*The vulnerability of fish at `stock_pc@Linf` . Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Fraction*

Assume all large fish are vulnerable.

```{r desc-fleet-vmaxlen-pc, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}
fleet_pc@Vmaxlen <-  c(1, 1) #c(0.05, 0.95) #
```
<!-- slot-chunk-end -->

<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### isRel {#app:desc-fleet-isrel-pc}

*Selectivity parameters in units of size-of-maturity (or absolute eg cm). Single value. Boolean.*

```{r desc-fleet-isrel-pc, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}
fleet_pc@isRel
```
<!-- slot-chunk-end -->

<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### LR5 {#app:desc-fleet-lr5-pc}

*Shortest length corresponding to 5 percent retention. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Non-negative real numbers*

Since we can assume that no Pacific Cod will survive if caught, we will set this to same as L5. Assume this is still relative to length at maturity??

```{r desc-fleet-lr5-pc, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}
fleet_pc@LR5 #<- c(0.2, 0.4)
```
<!-- slot-chunk-end -->

<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### LFR {#app:desc-fleet-lfr-pc}

*Shortest length that is fully retained. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Non-negative real numbers*

Use same as LFS. Assume this is still relative to length at maturity??

```{r desc-fleet-lfr-pc, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}
fleet_pc@LFR #<- c(0.95, 0.99)
```
<!-- slot-chunk-end -->

<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### Rmaxlen {#app:desc-fleet-rmaxlen-pc}

*The retention of fish at `stock_pc@Linf` . Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Non-negative real numbers*

Use same as VmaxLen. Assume this is still relative to length at maturity??

```{r desc-fleet-rmaxlen-pc, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}
fleet_pc@Rmaxlen #<- c(0.99, 1.5)
```
<!-- slot-chunk-end -->

<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### DR {#app:desc-fleet-dr-pc}

*Discard rate - the fraction of caught fish that are discarded. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Fraction*

```{r desc-fleet-dr-pc, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}
fleet_pc@DR #<- c(0.01,0.05)
```
<!-- slot-chunk-end -->









<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### CurrentYr {#app:desc-fleet-currentyr-pc}

*The current calendar year (final year) of the historical simulations (eg 2011). Single value. Positive integer.*

```{r desc-fleet-currentyr-pc, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}

```{r desc-obs-name-pc, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}
obs_pc@Name <- "BC Obs"
```
<!-- slot-chunk-end -->

<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### Cobs {#app:desc-obs-cobs-pc}

*Log-normal catch observation error expressed as a coefficient of variation. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Non-negative real numbers*

At least since 1996, observation error on catch should be very small.

TODO: does this affect historical build up because there was certainly much larger observation are on catch before 1996.

```{r desc-obs-cobs-pc, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}
obs_pc@Cobs <- c(0.05, 0.15)
```
<!-- slot-chunk-end -->

<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### Cbiascv {#app:desc-obs-cbiascv-pc}

*Log-normal coefficient of variation controlling the sampling of bias in catch observations for each simulation. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Non-negative real numbers*

We will keep the possible sampling bias quite small because observation error on catch should be very small with 100% on board and dockside monitoring.

```{r desc-obs-cbiascv-pc, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}
obs_pc@Cbiascv <- 0.05
```
<!-- slot-chunk-end -->

<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### CAA_nsamp {#app:desc-obs-caa_nsamp-pc}

*Number of catch-at-age observation per time step. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real numbers*

We will be unlikely to be working with any management procedures that use catch-at-age anyways so this and the following slots are not that imp_pcortant. They will only be used if we also explore some more data-rich management procedures.

TODO: Therefore, for now, I will not adjust these.

```{r desc-obs-caa_nsamp-pc, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}
obs_pc@CAA_nsamp
```
<!-- slot-chunk-end -->

<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### CAA_ESS {#app:desc-obs-caa_ess-pc}

*Effective sample size (independent age draws) of the multinomial catch-at-age observation error model. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive integers*

```{r desc-obs-caa_ess-pc, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}
obs_pc@CAA_ESS
```
<!-- slot-chunk-end -->

<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### CAL_nsamp {#app:desc-obs-cal_nsamp-pc}

*Number of catch-at-length observation per time step. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive integers*

```{r desc-obs-cal_nsamp-pc, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}
obs_pc@CAL_nsamp
```
<!-- slot-chunk-end -->

<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### CAL_ESS {#app:desc-obs-cal_ess-pc}

*Effective sample size (independent length draws) of the multinomial catch-at-length observation error model. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive integers*

```{r desc-obs-cal_ess-pc, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}
obs_pc@CAL_ESS
```
<!-- slot-chunk-end -->

<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### Iobs {#app:desc-obs-iobs-pc}

*Observation error in the relative abundance indices expressed as a coefficient of variation. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real numbers*

```{r}
average_cv <- dplyr::filter(dpc$survey_index, survey_abbrev == "SYN WCHG") %>%
  dplyr::pull(re) %>%
  mean() %>%
  round(2)
```

This will depend on whether we want to use one or more of the trawl surveys or commercial CPUE as the index. For now I will assume that we will work with one of the trawl surveys. In that case, the CV on the index is quite large for this species. For example, the best sampling is probably on the West Coast of Haidai Gwaii, and there the average CV is `r average_cv`. Let's place a range around that for now.

```{r desc-obs-iobs-pc, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}
obs_pc@Iobs <- c(0.3, 0.5)
```
<!-- slot-chunk-end -->

<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### Ibiascv {#app:desc-obs-ibiascv-pc}

*Log-normal coefficient of variation controlling error in observations of relative abundance index. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real numbers*

TODO: I believe this refers to bias from simulation run to run but I'm not sure. For now I will set it to  zero.

```{r desc-obs-ibiascv-pc, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}
obs_pc@Ibiascv <- c(0.333, 3.00)
```
<!-- slot-chunk-end -->

<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### Btobs {#app:desc-obs-btobs-pc}

*Log-normal coefficient of variation controlling error in observations of current stock biomass among years. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real numbers*

TODO: I'm not sure where this gets used are where we should draw this from. And how is this different from the index lots above? For now I will make it the same at `Iobs`

```{r desc-obs-btobs-pc, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}
obs_pc@Btobs <- obs_pc@Iobs
```
<!-- slot-chunk-end -->

<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### Btbiascv {#app:desc-obs-btbiascv-pc}

*Uniform-log bounds for sampling persistent bias in current stock biomass. Uniform-log distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real numbers*

```{r desc-obs-btbiascv-pc, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}
obs_pc@Btbiascv <- obs_pc@Ibiascv
```
<!-- slot-chunk-end -->

<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### beta {#app:desc-obs-beta-pc}

*A parameter controlling hyperstability/hyperdepletion where values below 1 lead to hyperstability (an index that decreases slower than true abundance) and values above 1 lead to hyperdepletion (an index that decreases more rapidly than true abundance). Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real numbers*

We probably don't have a lot to go on here so let's allow for a wide range:

```{r desc-obs-beta-pc, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}
obs_pc@beta <- c(0.666, 1.500)
```
<!-- slot-chunk-end -->

<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### LenMbiascv {#app:desc-obs-lenmbiascv-pc}

*Log-normal coefficient of variation for sampling persistent bias in length at 50 percent maturity. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real numbers*

We don't have a large number of biological samples for the species. It is possible there is some persistent bias in like that 50% maturity. Let's set this to a range from a little to a fair bit.

```{r desc-obs-lenmbiascv-pc, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}
obs_pc@LenMbiascv <- c(0.05, 0.20)

### Mbiascv {#app:desc-obs-mbiascv-pc}

*Log-normal coefficient of variation for sampling persistent bias in observed natural mortality rate. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real numbers*

We don't have good data to go on for natural mortality rate so let's allow for a fairly large range in persistent bias. As a reminder, we set M to be drawn from a uniform distribution between `r stock_pc@M[[1]]` and `r stock_pc@M[[2]]`.

```{r desc-obs-mbiascv-pc, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}
obs_pc@Mbiascv <- c(0.00, 0.00)

### Kbiascv {#app:desc-obs-kbiascv-pc}

*Log-normal coefficient of variation for sampling persistent bias in observed growth parameter K. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real numbers*

Again we do not have a large number of biological samples and the aging data has a fair bit of error in it, so let's set this to be arranged from a little bit to quite a bit:

```{r desc-obs-kbiascv-pc, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}
obs_pc@Kbiascv <- c(0.05, 0.20)
