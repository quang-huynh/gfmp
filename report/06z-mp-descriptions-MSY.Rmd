### `GB_target`: Geromont and Butterworth target CPUE and catch

An MP that modifies a time-series of catch recommendations and aims for a target catch rate and catch level based on $B\textrm{MSY}/B_0$ and MSY, respectively.

If $I_\textrm{recent}\ge I_0$ the TAC is calculated as:

$$
\textrm{TAC}= C_\textrm{ref}\left( w + (1-w)\frac{I_\textrm{rec}-I_0}{I_\textrm{target}-I_0} \right),
$$

otherwise:
$$
\textrm{TAC}= wC_\textrm{ref} \frac{I_\textrm{rec}}{I_0}^2,
$$

where $C_\textrm{ref}$ is a reference catch assumed to be a proxy for MSY, $w$ is a gain parameter, $I_\textrm{rec}$ is the average index over the last 4 years, $I\textrm{target}$ is the target Index, and $I_0$ is 0.2 x the average index over the past 5 years.

In the MSE $C_\textrm{ref}$ is the calculated MSY subject to observation error, and $I\textrm{target}$ is assumed to be the index at MSY subject to observation error.

The TAC is subject to the following conditions:

- if next TAC > 1.2 last catch, then $TAC = 1.2 * \textrm{last catch}$
- if next TAC < 0.8 last catch, then $TAC = 0.8 * \textrm{last catch}$

<!-- *TODO: this one assumes a proxy for MSY! remove?* -->
<!-- Thoughts:
- requires a reference index level and a reference catch (MSY)
- not suitable to combine with a historical reference level because we don't have index values going back that far to match up between the real and simulated data
-->

### `GB_CC`: Geromont and Butterworth constant catch

A simple MP that aims for a reference catch (as a proxy for MSY) subject to imperfect information. The TAC is calculated to be equivalent to a reference catch which is assumed to be a proxy for MSY. The TAC is calculated as:

$$
\textrm{TAC} = C_\textrm{ref},
$$

where $C_{ref}$ is the reference catch. In the MSE $C_{ref}$ is the calculated MSY subject to observation error, therefore it is important to adequately represent error on assumed MSY if this MP is then to be applied to real data. See @geromont2015\.

The TAC is subject to the following conditions:

- if next TAC > 1.2 last catch, then $TAC = 1.2 * \textrm{last catch}$
- if next TAC < 0.8 last catch, then $TAC = 0.8 * \textrm{last catch}$

<!-- *TODO: remove this MP because it assumes knowing MSY?* -->
<!-- Thoughts:
- this one might be a candidate to substitute an historical reference point
-->

### `SBT2`: Complex SBT1 Simple management procedure

SBT2, requires, amongst other things, knowledge of mean recruitment over the last 5 and 10 years! not realistic to apply in our case

For SBT2, the TAC is calculated as:

$$
\textrm{TAC}_y = 0.5 (C_{y-1} + C_\textrm{targ} \delta),
$$

where $C_{y-1}$ is catch in the previous year, $C_\textrm{targ}$ is a target catch, and:

$$
\delta =
\begin{cases}
R^{1+epsR} & \textrm{if}\ R \lt 1 \\
R^{1-epsR} & \textrm{if}\ R \ge 1,
\end{cases}
$$

where $epsR$ is a control parameter and $R = \frac{\bar{r}}{\phi}$ where $\bar{r}$ is the mean recruitment over the last 5 years and $\phi$ is the mean recruitment over the last 10 years.
