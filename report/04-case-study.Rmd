# REX SOLE CASE STUDY SUMMARY

We undertook a case study of the Rex Sole (*Glyptocephalus zachirus*) stock in the West Coast Vancouver Island (WCVI) groundfish management area (Area 3CD) to demonstrate an application of the MP Framework.
This stock was selected because it lacks recent ageing data, lacks current assessment advice, and has a contrasting life-history with that of Strait of Georgia Yelloweye Rockfish (*Sebastes ruberrimus*), a fish stock for which this framework has been applied concurrently [@haggarty2020yelloweye].
We briefly summarize the Rex Sole case study here. Full details are available in Appendix \@ref(app:mse-rex) and Appendix \@ref(app:desc-om-rex).
The case-study is presented to illustrate the framework and its outputs but *is not intended for the provision of catch advice at this time*.

Rex Sole are a flatfish caught primarily in the bottom-trawl fishery in BC.
They can live as long as 29 years, grow as large as 58 cm, and weigh up to 1.44 kg.
Otoliths have been collected regularly on BC surveys, but these otoliths have not been aged.
Rex Sole are caught regularly in the DFO synoptic bottom trawl surveys and relative biomass indexes calculated from these surveys have a relatively low level of observation error (CV [coefficient of variation] = 0.07--0.12) compared to many other groundfish stocks caught in the same survey.
Rex Sole in WCVI do not have an existing stock assessment or TAC.

**Decision context**:
The decision to be made was which MP to use to determine catch limits for the period until the next available catch advice.

**Objectives and performance metrics**:
We defined objectives and performance metrics following the provisional suggestions in Section \@ref(sec:approach2) that are guided by the Precautionary Approach Framework.
Since 1.5--2 Rex Sole generations would be less than 50 years, we chose to run our projections for 50 years (Section \@ref(sec:approach2)).

We defined the performance metrics as:

1. LT LRP: Probability *B* > 0.4 *B*~MSY~ (years 35--50)
2. LT USR: Probability *B* > 0.8 *B*~MSY~ (years 35--50)
3. FMSY: P(*F* < *F*~MSY~) (years 1--50)
4. STC: Probability catch > reference catch (years 1--10)
5. LTC: Probability catch > reference catch (years 35--50)
6. AADC: Probability AADC (average absolute interannual difference in catch) < historical AADC (years 1--50)

where reference catch was defined as the average catch from the last five years.

**Operating model specification**:
We established six reference-set OMs encompassing uncertainty in depletion of the stock prior to 1996, natural mortality (*M*), stock-recruit steepness (*h*), fishery and survey length selectivity, and the inclusion or exclusion of commercial CPUE effort data (Appendix \@ref(app:mse-rex) Section \@ref(sec:results-reference-set)).
We further established two robustness-set OMs encompassing less plausible but possible additional sources of structural uncertainty: (1) an OM scenario that assumes the stock was lightly fished before 1996 and excludes the CPUE data; and (2) an OM scenario that assesses robustness to future increases in natural mortality (possibly due to climate change or shifts in predator abundance) (Appendix \@ref(app:mse-rex) Section \@ref(sec:results-robustness-set)).

We documented the initial parameterization of the OMs (Appendix \@ref(app:desc-om-rex)) and the conditioning of the OMs using stochastic stock reduction analysis (SRA; Appendix \@ref(app:sra)).
The conditioning estimated biomass depletion in the last historical year, the magnitude of unfished recruitment, fishing mortality at age by year, and historical recruitment deviations.
We retained only parameter combinations that had plausible fits to the observed data in the SRA (Appendix \@ref(app:mse-rex) Section \@ref(sec:results-om-conditioning)).

**Candidate management procedure specification**:
We worked with the full set of provisional candidate MPs described in Appendix \@ref(app:MPs).
We modified the MPs to only observe even years of the survey index to reflect the biennial nature of the WCVI synoptic bottom trawl survey.

**Closed-loop simulation application**:
We applied satisficing criteria based on the LT LRP and STC performance metrics (minimum LT LRP > 0.9, minimum STC > 0.8). We discarded some MPs with near-identical performance to render a manageable set of seven MPs for further consideration.
These MPs included index-target MPs, surplus production models paired with a harvest control rule, and two constant-catch MPs.

**Presentation of results**:
We presented a number of visualizations featuring the OM reference-set scenarios to aid evaluating trade-offs amongst the seven satisficed MPs for final decision-making.
We averaged results across OM reference-set scenarios, to integrate across the various uncertainties represented by these OMs.
We presented probability results in terms of the average (Figures \@ref(fig:rex-tigure-avg)) and minimum performance (Figures \@ref(fig:rex-tigure-min)), where the latter accounts for the worst-case scenario among OM reference-set scenarios.
We suggest that Figures \@ref(fig:rex-tigure-avg) and \@ref(fig:rex-tigure-min) would be the primary source of information used by decision-makers to reach a final MP-selection decision.
To aid this decision, we included a number of other visualizations to help decision-makers understand the underlying dynamics and trade-offs of the various OMs across all satisficed MPs.

Finally, we assessed performance of the satisficed MPs under the OM robustness scenarios.
We present results from the two OM robustness scenarios separately to allow decision-makers to see performance of MPs under these less plausible OM scenarios.
Poor performance of an MP under one of these OM scenarios may influence a decision-maker to select another MP that performs well under both OM reference and robustness scenarios.
Four Itarget MPs (Appendix \@ref(app:MPs) Section \@ref(sec:mp-itarget)) were relatively robust to the OM scenario where the stock was lightly fished prior to 1996 and to increasing natural mortality in the future.
Conversely, the constant catch and surplus production MPs had substantially lower probabilities of achieving the LT LRP objective under the lightly fished OM robustness scenario.

We provide a full set of results and interpretation of results in Appendix \@ref(app:mse-rex).
