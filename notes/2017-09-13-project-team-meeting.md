# Meeting objectives

Ensure everyone has an up-to-date understanding of the current status of the project, developments since the tiered-approach workshop, and the related DLMtool DFO-funded project.

Agree to project goals and objectives as defined in the Project Charter.

Review the recommendations from the previous workshop proceedings to ensure we consider the recommendations in this new version of the project.

Review and confirm the project boundaries as defined in the scoping table in the Project Charter.

Agree to reasonable project milestones and set a draft timetable as defined in the Project Charter.

Determine each author team member's interest, available time to devote to this project, and high-level role in the project.

Decide on author team meeting schedule and establish each individual's tasks to be completed before our next meeting.

Brainstorm list of potential technical working group members to reach out to.


# Meeting agenda

* Welcome and review of objectives and agenda. Adjust as necessary.

* A quick summary of the history of the former tiered-approach project [Greg]

* Review tiered approach workshop recommendations (come back to later)

* A quick summary of the related DLMtool DFO-funded project [Robyn]

* Current status
    - Now Sean's main project; will be Elise's main project soon
    - Project Charter in draft form
    - Met with Tom, Adrian, and Robyn at UBC
    - Started developing shortraker rockfish OM as a learning exercise
    - Literature review, Zotero library, Github repository with code, notes, writing
    - Have a copy of GFASTeR from Norm in private repository updated with Roxygen, have access to draft scorecard SQL code

* Project goals and objectives
    - Agree to project goals and objectives as defined in the Project Charter.
    - Discuss and edit as necessary.
    - Consider workshop recommendations. Which are suitable for the new project and which should we decide to leave behind?

* Discuss and brainstorm scoping table in the Project Charter to carefully define the boundaries
    - Review the table and edit it as necessary 
    - Brainstorm additional scoping restrictions 
    - Make sure we cover invertebrates

* Project milestones discussion
    - Review table and edit as necessary
    
* Brainstorm list of potential technical working group members

* Review possible roles
    - Review and edit list of possible roles
    - Determine everyone's interest, available time to devote to this project, and high-level role in the project

* Discuss meeting schedule and establish tasks for next meeting
    - How frequently should we meet?
    - One meeting before technical working group meeting #1?
    - Schedule next meeting
    - Agree to tasks to complete by specific date 


# Possible roles

1. Establishing candidate fisheries objectives 

1. Selecting candidate management procedures and providing brief documentation on the justification for their selection, possibly based on performance in previous simulation projects and/or performance with our generic operating models.

1. Testing the sensitivity of DLMtool to data-stripping?

1. Developing generic operating models for species groups

1. Applying framework to 1--2 stocks as an example and to establish a template for analyses, figures, and reporting

1. Documenting minutes from Working Group meetings

1. Reaching out to invite potential Working Group members

1. Literature review of management procedure approaches for Working Paper introduction

1. Development of R package to facilitate scorecard generation with GFASTeR

1. Development of R package to make consistently styled DFO plots with DLMtool

1. Overseeing scorecard Science Response document

1. Organizing and writing the majority of the Working Paper

# Recommendations from the tiered approach workshop

* Develop a terms of reference and workplan for an advisory group (technical working group, TWG), identify members of the TWG, and clarify each member’s duties and expected participation. The short-term next steps for a TWG are:

    * Adopt the candidate Tiers 1-5 for communication of data availability to clients but amalgamate Tiers 3-5 for analysis and simulations.

    * Design the simulation testing appropriate for each tier.

    * Do not use precautionary buffers and caps. Account for risk and uncertainty either within the stock assessment outputs (Tiers 1-2) or when using closed-loop simulation to select an assessment method (Tiers 3-5).

    * Use the data scorecard as presented in the workshop to summarise data needed for simulations and to communicate data availability.

    * Identify management objectives and performance metrics to measure performance of alternative assessment methods.

    * Articulate the methods by which species are placed in tiers.

    * Scope DLMtool and customise for Canadian groundfish fisheries, if needed.

    * Examine types of data available in more detail.

    * Examine processes by which a species moves up or down tiers.

* Write code for DLMtool to test the sensitivity of data-stripping and performance of alternative assessment methods for stocks with different abundance trends.

* Develop a prioritization scorecard that takes into account the factors important to the BC groundfish sector.

* Develop a schedule for reviewing the placement of species within the TA framework.

* Collaborate with the CIC-led advisory process: Multi-species Management Systems.
